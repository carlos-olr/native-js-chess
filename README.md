# Simple Native HTML5 and Javascrit Chess!

I wokeup wondering to programming someting fun ( ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ), and as I had recentemente watched Queen's Gambit series in Netflix, so I decided to create Chess game, simple, useful, prety and only with native tecnologies.


# Why native?

This is funny, or (probabily) is funny just for me, I love to teach programming and I have a special care about the basics topics, I think that occurs cause I like understand how the great and famous libries works and in certain point of his code they use the native tools and resources of they languages.

So that is, is interessing to learn about how the complex things are made.

Enjoy it!
